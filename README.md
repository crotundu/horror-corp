# HorrorCorp

A playground for an Nx, React, Module Federation Microfrontends project. I know, it's a mouthful.

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Understand this workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.

## Developing

Create a new library (it places **ui** folder inside the **lib/shell** folder. **lib** is a predefined location for libraries). A new project called **shell-ui** will result from this.
`nx g @nx/react:library ui --directory=shell --component=false`

Create a new component in the above created library project:
`nx g component header --project=shell-ui`

## Running

Serving **shell** in development mode and the remotes in static mode.
`nx serve shell --open`

To run one or more remotes in development mode, use the `--devRemotes` option.
`nx serve shell --open --devRemotes=cart,shop`

To run the production build (containers):
`nx run-many -t build-docker` followed by `docker-compose up`, in the workspace root.

To check what is affected by current change:
`nx affected:graph`

## Remote caching

Run `npx nx connect-to-nx-cloud` to enable [remote caching](https://nx.app) and make CI faster.

## Further help

Visit the [Nx Documentation](https://nx.dev) to learn more.

## Dev notes

Run `nx g @nx-go/nx-go:app api --useGoWork` to create a new Go app. The `--useGoWork` will create a **go.work** workspace file that allows maintaining multiple
go.mod files (per app).
